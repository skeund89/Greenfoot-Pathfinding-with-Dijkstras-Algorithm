# Rover Pathfinding with Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Introduction
This repository contains a Java project for a rover simulation that demonstrates pathfinding using Dijkstra's algorithm. The rover navigates a grid-based world in Greenfoot, finding the shortest path from a starting point to an endpoint while mapping its surroundings.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skeund89/Greenfoot-Pathfinding-with-Dijkstras-Algorithm.git
   ```

## Folder Setup
After cloning the repository, set up the project in Greenfoot:
1. Launch Greenfoot and create a new scenario.
2. Import the `Project 2.0` folder into your Greenfoot project workspace.

## Executing the Project
1. Open the Greenfoot IDE and load the project (`Project 2.0`) into the workspace.
2. Locate the `Rover` class and ensure it is set as the main class for execution.
3. Configure the initial parameters (`endpos_x`, `endpos_y`) within the `Rover` class's `Projekt` method.
4. Run the project to observe the rover's pathfinding behavior.

## Project Method Overview
The main method in this project is `Projekt(int endpos_x, int endpos_y)` within the `Rover` class:
- **Initialization**: Initializes the grid world and places the start and end nodes.
- **Mapping**: Maps the terrain using the rover's movement capabilities.
- **Pathfinding**: Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the end node.
- **Navigation**: Guides the rover along the shortest path found, updating the map with the optimal route.

This project showcases how Dijkstra's algorithm can be applied to solve pathfinding problems in a simulated environment.
